--To re-compile all files, run these two lines:
javac -d bin src/util/*.java src/communication/*.java src/replica/*.java
javac -d . src/*.java

--To run from command line:
java Master

--To run processes separately from command line
cd bin
java replica.Replica {ID}         (for first replica)
java replica.Replica {ID} {ID of replica to write me into the system}
java replica.Client {ID} {ID of replica to connect to}

--Design:
Upon creation, replicas ask some other replica for a name and block until they receive one.  The naming server will make an ADD operation that is treated the same as a write to the log (but not printed in the log).
Anti-entropy communications are sent periodically between servers that know of each other's existence.  To stabilize, the program simply blocks for a long time.  Processes also inform the Master of how many stable writes they've seen, so that the stabilization wait can end early in most cases.
Disconnects between replicas are handled by each replica's communication object, and not "known" by replicas themselves.
Clients and replicas are separate Java processes that use their default I/O to talk to the Master.
